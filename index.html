            We do Agile! So we love big, real world Task Boards.

            But we also love Trello, Jira and the Web Task Boards that let us get flow statistics and data that we can act upon!

            It was time to link those worlds. We designed a special, extremely high definition camera that will look at your board and match the columns and items,
            with what you have on Web boards.

            We called it TASKBOARDLINK on an illuminated afternoon and we sell it for a cheap subscription, support it 24x7 all over the World, and give you API access to get even more.
